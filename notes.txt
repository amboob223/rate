this app I guess will be the date thing the key on here is to again do the request but also get data
with photos and make tables although there are no tables we got to get creative or use the react-native -table -component

// the form will get name photo relationship status info and geoloctION 

    //COMPONENTS

            // SO WE need a form component that takes the initial form that keeps the daters info 
            // a home component that describes the point of the iste
                - the site is to make a review for a date and a user name so thst people can see if they can remember the date 
                - we need a review component maybe that will take a prop of the data from the usser
                


Creating design documents for a dating app involves outlining the structure, functionality, and user interface of the application. Below are design documents in a simplified format, including user stories, component details, and considerations for the form, home, and review components. Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to adapt it based on the specific features and requirements of your app.

User Stories:
As a user, I want to provide information about my date experience, including name, photo, relationship status, additional info, and geolocation.
As a user, I want to view the home page to understand the purpose of the app.
As a user, I want to leave a review about a date, including the date's information and my thoughts.
As a user, I want to see reviews left by others to gather insights about potential dates.
Components:
Form Component:
Props:
onSubmit: Function to handle form submission.
Fields:
Name
Photo (upload or select from gallery)
Relationship status
Additional information
Geolocation
Actions:
Submit button triggers onSubmit with form data.
Home Component:
Content:
Introduction to the app's purpose.
Brief instructions on leaving and viewing reviews.
Prompts users to use the Form Component.
Review Component:
Props:
reviewData: Object containing information about the date.
Content:
Display the date's name, photo, relationship status, additional info, and geolocation.
Allow users to leave a review.
Display existing reviews (if any).
Design Considerations:
Navigation:

Consider using a navigation library like react-navigation to navigate between different components.
Styling:

Use a consistent color scheme and styling across components for a cohesive look.
Forms:

Implement form validation to ensure the completeness and accuracy of user input.
Photos:

Explore options for handling user photos, including image upload or selection from the gallery.
Data Management:

Decide on the data storage mechanism for user information and reviews. This may involve using a backend server or local storage.
Geolocation:

If geolocation is a crucial feature, ensure that it is handled appropriately, considering user privacy and permissions.
Review Interaction:

Consider adding features like star ratings or comment sections for users to provide detailed feedback.
Responsiveness:

Design components to be responsive to different screen sizes, ensuring a positive user experience on various devices.
Testing:

Plan for testing different scenarios, including form submissions, data retrieval, and component interactions.
User Experience:

Prioritize a user-friendly interface, minimizing friction for users when navigating and interacting with the app.
Remember that this is a broad outline, and you may need to dive deeper into each component based on your app's complexity and specific features. Additionally, integrating a backend service will be necessary for storing and retrieving user data.




now with the rate app we only need to know how to render 
a picture back so we can put in the frame and we need to 
make the description box so that  people can leave they 
review and show who they was on a date with 

and i want to make an api call that shows a tellswhew peoplw can ping there date location 
and we got to give it some auth

he require function in React Native is used for static image resources that are bundled with the app during the build process. In your case, you are trying to dynamically load an image using a URI from the server, so require is not suitable for this scenario.

notes form this projects  
  -be cognizant of node version you might have to update to get expo ro worked  
  - IN MULter you dont have to acces the filename property or decpnstruict the photo only the id 
  - form data and photo data is handled diffrent and can be made making two sepereate endpoints one for the text and one for non text info  
  - expo-image-picker, and file system are from expo library with all they ways to freak the canmera on an android phone

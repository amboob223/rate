this app I guess will be the date thing the key on here is to again do the request but also get data
with photos and make tables although there are no tables we got to get creative or use the react-native -table -component

// the form will get name photo relationship status info and geoloctION 

    //COMPONENTS

            // SO WE need a form component that takes the initial form that keeps the daters info 
            // a home component that describes the point of the iste
                - the site is to make a review for a date and a user name so thst people can see if they can remember the date 
                - we need a review component maybe that will take a prop of the data from the usser
                


Creating design documents for a dating app involves outlining the structure, functionality, and user interface of the application. Below are design documents in a simplified format, including user stories, component details, and considerations for the form, home, and review components. Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to adapt it based on the specific features and requirements of your app.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to view the home page to understand the purpose of the app.
As a user, I want to leave a review about a date, including the date's information and my thoughts.
As a user, I want to see reviews left by others to gather insights about potential dates.

Consider adding features like star ratings or comment sections for users to provide detailed feedback.
Responsiveness:

Design components to be responsive to different screen sizes, ensuring a positive user experience on various devices.
Testing:

Plan for testing different scenarios, including form submissions, data retrieval, and component interactions.
User Experience:

Prioritize a user-friendly interface, minimizing friction for users when navigating and interacting with the app.
